# IMPLEMENTATION-OF-REGRESSION-MODEL-AND-CLUSTERING

This project focuses on the implementation of regression models and clustering algorithms to analyze and interpret complex datasets. Regression models are utilized to predict continuous outcomes based on independent variables, with techniques such as Linear Regression, Multiple Regression, and Polynomial Regression being employed to establish relationships between variables. Clustering, an unsupervised machine learning technique, is implemented to group data points based on similarity, using algorithms like K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN. The project aims to demonstrate the practical applications of these techniques in real-world scenarios, such as market segmentation, sales forecasting, and customer behavior analysis. Through data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization, this study highlights the effectiveness of regression and clustering methods in extracting meaningful insights, improving decision-making processes, and enhancing data-driven strategies.
